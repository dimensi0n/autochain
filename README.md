# AutoChain

This repository is a little project in order to get into the blockchain.
It has no security like PoW (Proof of Work).
But it was enough for me to discover the most basic stage of the blockchain's creation.
Hash are generated with the SHA256 algorithm.
It is providing a chain and it's validation method.
It comes with unit tests written with the help of Jest.
